The **SODATA group** in the [Department of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science)
at [Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/) aims to enable **interactive and scalable data science**  in an era of
ever-growing data volumes and increasingly fast data streams. Our vision is to make large-scale
data science responsive by design, allowing users and systems to reason over massive, continuously
evolving data in near real time, typically with millisecond- to sub-second latency.

We focus on the design of algorithms and data structures that **deliver responses within (milli)seconds**,
enabling meaningful human interaction with data and timely automated decision making. Such
responsiveness is essential to
keep users engaged in the data science workflow, to ensure results remain current in fast-paced streaming
environments, and to support immediate action in time-critical domains such as security monitoring and
fraud detection.

To realize this vision, we develop approximate algorithms and compact data structures -- typically called
*synopses* -- that summarize high-volume data streams and time series using limited computational resources.
In parallel, we design and implement distributed algorithms that scale efficiently across hundreds of machines.
Our research forms the foundation for applications ranging from sensor network analytics and large-scale
similarity detection to, more recently, efficient and scalable AI training.

### Collaboration opportunities
We actively seek collaborations with academic partners, research institutes, and not-for-profit
organizations to tackle challenging problems aligned with our expertise. We also collaborate
closely with industry, both through EU-funded projects and company-funded research. If you are
interested in exploring a collaboration, we would be happy to hear from you.
