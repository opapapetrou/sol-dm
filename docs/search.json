Online analytics comes with strict performance requirements: the results need to be made available almost instantaneously, to allow for interactivity. Sustainability, on the other hand, refers to different properties of the desired solutions: (a) low cost, (b) scalability with the data size and velocity, (c) ease of use at different situations. I have key contributions towards this direction, by building (a) easy-to-use data synopses that allow efficient compact summarization and analytics, and, (b) streaming algorithms, that facilitate processing of the data at line speed.\n\n\nRecent Professional Service\n\n2027: PC member for SIGMOD’27.\n2026: PC member for EDBT’26, Light Load Reviewer for VLDB’26.\n2025: PC member for VLDB Demonstration track, ICDE Industrial track, EDBT; co-chair for MulTiSA@ICDE’25; co-chair for interactive session The role of Data Management in the Era of AI at NWO ICT.Open’25.\n2024: Publication and proceedings chair for ICDE; co-chair for MulTiSA@ICDE’24; PC member for SIGMOD, EDBT; rapid response reviewer for VLDB.\n\n\n\nRecent Awards and Recognitions\n\nApril 2025: SIGMOD Research Highlight Award for OmniSketch.\nApril 2025: Distinguished Reviewer Award at SIGMOD’25.\nApril 2025: PC Honorable Mention at EDBT’25.\nAugust 2024: Our work OmniSketch received the best paper award at VLDB’24.\n\n\n\nContact details\n\nPhone: +31 40 247 6087\nVisiting address: MetaForum 7.090, Eindhoven University of Technology, 5600 MB, Eindhoven, The Netherlands\nPostal address: M&CS department, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, PO Box 513, 5600 MB Eindhoven, The Netherlands\n\n\n\n\nRecent publications\n\n\nWieger Punter, Odysseas Papapetrou, Minos Garofalakis: OmniSketch: Multi-Dimensional Update Stream Analytics with Arbitrary Predicates.

    "text": "The SOL-DM group in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Eindhoven University of Technology aims to enable interactive and scalable data science in an era of ever-growing data volumes and increasingly fast data streams. Our vision is to make large-scale data science responsive by design, allowing users and systems to reason over massive, continuously evolving data in near real time, typically with millisecond- to sub-second latency.\nWe focus on the design of algorithms and data structures that deliver responses within seconds, enabling meaningful human interaction with data and timely automated decision making. Such responsiveness is essential to keep users engaged in the data science workflow, to ensure results remain current in fast-paced streaming environments, and to support immediate action in time-critical domains such as security monitoring and fraud detection.\nTo realize this vision, we develop approximate algorithms and compact data structures – typically called synopses – that summarize high-volume data streams and time series using limited computational resources. In parallel, we design and implement distributed algorithms that scale efficiently across hundreds of machines. Our research forms the foundation for applications ranging from sensor network analytics and large-scale similarity detection to, more recently, efficient and scalable AI training.\n\nKeywords\n\nStreaming algorithms and analytics\nApproximate query processing with synopses\nTime-series data management\nScalable data systems\n\n\n\nCollaboration opportunities\nWe actively seek collaborations with academic partners, research institutes, and not-for-profit organizations to tackle challenging problems aligned with our expertise. We also collaborate closely with industry, both through EU-funded projects and company-funded research. If you are interested in exploring a collaboration, we would be happy to hear from you."
